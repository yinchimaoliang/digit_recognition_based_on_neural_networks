# digit_recognition_based_on_neural_networks
a way of implementing digit recognition based on MNIST and neural networks
environments:caffe,sys,PyQt5,numpy

If you want to retrain the neural networks,you need to unpack MNIST.rar which is in the data folder first,and then run the "generate_training_file.py"

If you just want to see the performence of the program,you just need to run the "main.py"
